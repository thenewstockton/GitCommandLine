git difftool //using p4merge

comparing working directory and the last commit:

git diff HEAD
git difftool HEAD

comparing staging area and the last commit:

git diff 094a5a1 HEAD //compare 094a5a1 and HEAD
git diff HEAD HEAD^ //compare HEAD and HEAD minus 1
git diff 094a5a1 abc123ab //compare 094a5a1 abc123ab

git diff master origin/master
