show changes with file name only:
git diff --name-only SHA1 SHA2

list branches:
git branch -a

branching:
git branch mynewbranch //create new branch
git checkout mynewbranch //switch
git branch -m mynewbranch newbranch //rename
git branch -d newbranch //delete


Happy path / fast forward merges (when master no changes):

git checkout -b newBranch //create and switch to newBranch
--assume we changed something
git difftool master titleBranch
git merge titleBranch //merge titleBranch from master

Disable fast forward merges:
git checkout -b newBranch //create and switch to newBranch
--assume we changed something
git checkout master
git merge testB --no-ff

conclusions: 
    Fast forward merge : you can't see merge tree
    no fast forward merge: you see the merge tree

Automatic merges:
git checkout -b newBranch //create and switch to newBranch
--assume we changed something
git checkout master
git merge newBranch -m "merging changes" //this will do a automatic merge


Conflicts:
git checkout -b realwork
--assumed we changed something in realwork and master (same line)
git merge realwork
git mergetool
git commit -m "resolved"
